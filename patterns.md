## Tangential Drift — Extended Examples

### Fiction (Fantasy)
> **Before:** The wizard opened his spellbook.
>
> **After:** The wizard opened his spellbook—a tome bound in what he'd been told was drake leather, though his mentor had also claimed to have met a dragon once, which seemed unlikely given that Aldric had never left the eastern provinces and dragons hadn't been seen east of the Thornwood since the Second Compact, assuming the Second Compact had actually happened and wasn't just something the Academy invented to justify their monopoly on defensive wards, which reminded him that he still owed Master Pembry three silvers for that failed scrying lesson...

### Non-Fiction (History)
> **Before:** The treaty was signed in 1648.
>
> **After:** The treaty was signed in 1648—though "signed" perhaps overstates the enthusiasm of the signatories, several of whom had traveled considerable distances under conditions that, by contemporary accounts, involved no small amount of dysentery, which was common enough at the time given the state of roadside provisions, and which may explain why the Bavarian delegate's signature appears somewhat unsteady in the original document, assuming it is the original, as there's been some scholarly debate since Hoffmann's 1987 paper...

### Technical
> **Before:** The function returns a boolean value.
>
> **After:** The function returns a boolean value—true or false, in the classical sense, though of course JavaScript's notion of truthiness complicates matters, as anyone who's debugged a conditional at 3am knows all too well, which reminds me of a deployment incident in 2019 involving an empty string that the QA team swore they'd tested, though their test environment was running Node 10 and production had been upgraded to 12 without anyone updating the documentation, which is really a process failure more than anything...

### Dialogue
> **Before:** "I need help," she said.
>
> **After:** "I need help," she said, "though 'help' is maybe too strong a word—assistance, guidance, a nudge in the right direction, really—because the thing is, my aunt used to say that asking for help was the first step to not needing it, which never made sense to me, but then again she also kept seventeen cats and named them all Margaret, so perhaps her wisdom was context-dependent, and speaking of context—"

## Excessive Qualification — Extended Examples

### Fiction (Literary)
> **Before:** He was a good man.
>
> **After:** He was a good man—or at least, he was not an actively bad one, which may or may not be the same thing depending on one's ethical framework, and accounting for the fact that goodness, such as it is, exists on a spectrum that shifts with cultural context, generational expectations, and the specific circumstances of any given Tuesday afternoon, one could say, with appropriate caveats and reasonable disclaimers, that he was, perhaps, probably, in the aggregate and on balance, not entirely without positive qualities, such as they were.

### Academic
> **Before:** The results support our hypothesis.
>
> **After:** The results support—or, more precisely, fail to contradict, within the limitations of our sample size (n=47, which, while adequate for preliminary analysis, cannot be considered definitive), our methodology (which, as noted in Section 3.2, carries certain acknowledged constraints), and our operational definitions (which may or may not align with those used in prior literature, a discrepancy we address, however imperfectly, in Appendix C)—the hypothesis, such as it was initially formulated, though subsequent refinements may necessitate revisiting this conclusion.

### Business
> **Before:** We recommend proceeding with the merger.
>
> **After:** We recommend—and "recommend" here should be understood in the context of available information as of Q3, market conditions subject to change, regulatory considerations that remain, as of this writing, somewhat fluid, and the inherent uncertainties of any forward-looking assessment—proceeding, or at minimum not not-proceeding, with the merger, assuming stakeholder alignment, board approval, and favorable due diligence outcomes, which, while anticipated, cannot be guaranteed.

### Dialogue
> **Before:** "I love you," he said.
>
> **After:** "I love you," he said, "or—well, 'love' is such a specific word, isn't it? What I mean is, I have feelings, strong feelings, or at least feelings that feel strong, relatively speaking, compared to other feelings I've had, not that I'm comparing you to anyone, that's not what I—the point is, in a manner of speaking, with appropriate qualifications, I... care. Deeply. Probably."

## Circular Repetition — Extended Examples

### Fiction (Thriller)
> **Before:** She knew too much.
>
> **After:** She knew too much. Had learned more than she should have. Acquired information beyond the acceptable threshold. What she'd discovered—what she'd pieced together, uncovered, figured out—exceeded safe parameters. She was over-informed. Dangerously aware. The point being, the bottom line, the crux of the matter: she knew too much.

### Non-Fiction (Journalism)
> **Before:** The policy failed.
>
> **After:** The policy failed. It did not succeed. The intended outcomes were not achieved, did not materialize, failed to manifest. What was supposed to happen didn't. The initiative fell short. Underperformed. Missed its targets. In summary, to put it plainly, stated clearly: the policy failed.

### Technical (Documentation)
> **Before:** The connection timed out.
>
> **After:** The connection timed out. The request exceeded its allocated duration. The server did not respond within the expected window—failed to reply, returned no acknowledgment, provided no response before the deadline elapsed. The timeout threshold was breached. Surpassed. Exceeded. The connection, in short, timed out.

### Dialogue
> **Before:** "We're lost," he admitted.
>
> **After:** "We're lost," he admitted. "We don't know where we are. Our location is, shall we say, uncertain. Unknown. We've misplaced ourselves geographically. Directionally compromised. The map and the territory have... diverged. What I'm saying is—what I mean to say, what I'm getting at here—we're lost."

## Associative Leapfrogging — Extended Examples

### Fiction (Contemporary)
> **Before:** She checked her phone.
>
> **After:** She checked her phone, which had a crack in the corner from when she'd dropped it at Marcus's birthday party, the one where his mother had made that terrible cake, though "terrible" was harsh since the woman had genuinely tried, unlike her own mother who'd once served store-bought cupcakes still in the packaging, but then again her mother had been dealing with the divorce that year, which was also the year she'd first tried coffee, which made her think she should probably get coffee, and also that she had three unread messages.

### Non-Fiction (Memoir/Personal)
> **Before:** I visited the old house.
>
> **After:** I visited the old house, which still had that crooked mailbox my father never fixed, and seeing it made me remember the letters I used to send to my pen pal in Ohio—Sandra? Sarah? Something with an S—who'd once sent me a photograph of her dog, a beagle I think, and I'd wanted a beagle after that but we got a cat instead, a gray one named Chester who lived eighteen years and outlasted two marriages, neither of them mine, which is its own kind of luck I suppose.

### Technical (Blog Post)
> **Before:** I learned Python last year.
>
> **After:** I learned Python last year, which I'd been meaning to do since my college roommate—Dave, who now works at some fintech startup in Austin, or maybe it's Denver—showed me a script he'd written to automate his fantasy football picks, and I remember thinking "that's either genius or cheating" but never decided which, though I did decide that automation was the future, which is also what my uncle said about the microwave in 1987, and look how that turned out, which is to say: I learned Python.

### Dialogue
> **Before:** "I saw your brother yesterday," she mentioned.
>
> **After:** "I saw your brother yesterday," she mentioned, "at the grocery store, the one near the old cinema that used to show those double features back when tickets were five dollars, which my grandmother always said was already too expensive, though she also thought television would be a fad, which—anyway, your brother, he was buying lemons, which made me think of that lemonade stand you two had as kids, the one where you accidentally gave change in buttons? Did I ever tell you my cousin did the same thing? He's a banker now, which is either ironic or fitting, I can never decide."

## Over-Inclusion of Detail — Extended Examples

### Fiction (Mystery)
> **Before:** He entered the room.
>
> **After:** He entered the room—a twelve-by-fourteen space on the third floor, northeast corner, accessible via the service stairwell (twenty-three steps, the seventh of which creaked at approximately 2.3 kilohertz) or the main elevator (a 1987 Otis model, capacity 2,000 pounds, last inspected on March 14th of the previous year by one Gerald Hutchins, badge number 4471). The door, solid oak, 82 inches tall, brass knob (manufacturer: Baldwin, model 5025-003), swung inward on three hinges, the uppermost of which showed 0.3 millimeters of lateral play.

### Non-Fiction (Travel)
> **Before:** We arrived at the hotel.
>
> **After:** We arrived at the hotel—the Grand Meridian, 4-star, 247 rooms across 12 floors, located at 1847 Coastal Highway (GPS coordinates: 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W), built in 1962 by the Harrington Development Group and renovated in 1989, 2003, and most recently in October 2021 at a cost of $4.7 million—at precisely 3:47pm local time, fourteen minutes ahead of the 4:01pm check-in window indicated in our confirmation email (booking reference: HM-7829-KL, sent at 2:33pm EST on the 14th).

### Technical
> **Before:** Install the package using npm.
>
> **After:** Install the package using npm (Node Package Manager, version 6.14.0 or higher, originally created by Isaac Z. Schlueter in 2010, now maintained by npm, Inc., a subsidiary of GitHub, itself owned by Microsoft as of October 26, 2018) by executing the command `npm install package-name@2.4.7` in your terminal (bash, zsh, or compatible shell, with PATH variable correctly configured to include /usr/local/bin or equivalent, permissions level 755 or higher on the target directory, typically node_modules, which should be 4,096 bytes minimum for the directory entry itself).

### Dialogue
> **Before:** "I met him at a coffee shop," she explained.
>
> **After:** "I met him at a coffee shop," she explained, "the Daily Grind on 4th and Morrison—not the original location, that closed in 2019, but the second one, the one with the green awning, 14 feet wide, that replaced the previous burgundy one sometime around February of last year—on a Wednesday, the 17th, 2:15pm give or take, I'd ordered a medium oat milk latte, $5.75 plus tax, and he was at table six, the one by the window, southeast exposure, reading the Times, Arts section, page C4."

## Combining Patterns

For maximum rambling effect, patterns can be layered:

### Tangential Drift + Over-Inclusion
> **Before:** The meeting started late.
>
> **After:** The meeting started late—11:47am instead of the scheduled 11:30am, which was itself a compromise from the originally proposed 11:15am that Janet from Accounting had suggested, though Janet (employee ID 4472, hired March 2019, desk 3B in the east wing) had also suggested holding meetings standing up to keep them short, an idea she'd gotten from a TED talk, or possibly a podcast, one of those productivity ones hosted by that guy who used to work at Google, or was it Facebook, anyway the point being that the meeting was seventeen minutes late, which in meeting-minutes converts to roughly four agenda items...

### Excessive Qualification + Circular Repetition
> **Before:** The project succeeded.
>
> **After:** The project succeeded—or rather, it achieved a state that could, with appropriate caveats regarding the definition of success, be considered successful, or at minimum not unsuccessful, which is to say it worked, more or less, in a manner of speaking, accounting for variables, it did what it was supposed to do, accomplished its purpose, met its objectives (such as they were, loosely defined as they may have been), which is to say, in summary, with qualifications noted: it succeeded. Probably. Mostly.
